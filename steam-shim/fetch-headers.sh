# Assemble the headers the shim compiles against, into proton-headers/ next to the
# sources so the whole include set sits under srcdir once build.sh syncs it across.
#
# Three of them come from Proton submodules, which a codeload tarball does not carry:
# it records openvr and wine as empty directories. They are fetched individually at
# the commits Proton pins on proton_9.0, which is the branch this shim's steam.cpp
# comes from, and each is checked against its recorded hash. Nothing else in either
# submodule is used: openvr.h pulls in only stdint.h and string, ivrclientcore.h
# includes nothing, and heap.h needs winbase.h, which the wine tree supplies.
#
# The Steamworks SDK headers are Valve's too but arrive with lsteamclient, so they
# are copied from the tree its fetch.sh assembles rather than fetched again.
#
# Usage:
#   ./fetch-headers.sh            assemble if needed
#   ./fetch-headers.sh --refetch  discard the cache first
#
# Overridable: OPENVR_COMMIT, PROTON_WINE_COMMIT, CACHE, OUT, LSC_TREE
